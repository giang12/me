### List of questions I have been asked and remembered, so you won't repeat them

+ What's your mission?

I believe this world we live in is far from Utopia. However, the power to influence it is in our hands, on our finger tips, literally. My mission is to use my skills, knowledge, or whatever it takes to make life better for people around me.

+ Consider something in your life you think goes unnoticed and write about why it's important to you

What would my life and other people’s lives be without my existence? This philosophical question has been on my mind for longer than I can remember. What would happen in this life if I were in another life? Instead of sitting next to Kristen in AP Government fifth period, I could have been any where else in the world or simply not existed at all. Instead of being here at this very moment, 3:00 AM in the morning in Springfield, Virginia, I could have been in Vietnam selling shoes to buy a loaf of bread for dinner. Sometimes I wonder if I was really talking to someone I was talking to. It could have been a lucid dream of me having a conversation with someone, but in reality I’m sleeping in the waiting room.
If I were in another life or simply not existed, would my seat in fifth period be vacant or would someone else fill it? Would there be any significant differences for other people’s life whether I’m here or Vietnam at this very moment? And If I was talking to someone in my lucid dream, who would that person be talking to in real life? All these mysteries of possibility float around in my mind every single second. I do not have the answer for them. I only know the source of it.
I had a chance to be two completely different people at the age of two months. My gambling addict father sold me for $200 over a couple hands of poker. I would have had a different name with different identity in a different life. Sometimes I wonder what would my other life be if my mom had not bought me back. It is a fascinating situation to think about in my leisure time. No, I do not hate my dad; I used to, but now I’m kind of glad everything happened the way it did.
I do not know what my life and other people’s lives would be without my existence. However, I know that my existence in this life has an impact on other people. There must be a good reason for my mom to bring me into this life, not once, but twice. It is important to me to know that I’m not here to fill the space but my existence has a higher purpose. And it is also important to me to know that I’m the essential piece to complete the puzzle. Because of this, I try to do my best to fulfill my purpose of existence. I try to leave a positive footprint in people’s lives, whether in a lucid dream or in real life. 

+ Why engineering? 

Writing code is cool; writing code to move a 120-pound robot is way cooler. Considering myself a hacker, tinkerer, and maker, I have been interested in the elegant interactions between hardware and software since I was a child. The ways in which these technologies work together to create something beautiful and useful from PID-controlled drive systems to a smart home entertainment system, are impressive and inspiring to me. As Alan Kay said, "people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." And as I delve deeper into the world of programming, I cannot help but become more interested in electrical components and their critical roles in computing such as how transistors drive much of the processing power today, or the way bits are stored and accessed on physically disk encourages a row-first looping when writing code.
Upon graduation, I plan to work on creating new wearable technologies that combine various electrical and software components with the intention of helping people improve their Emotional Intelligence (a link to a PowerPoint is attached below *). I believe by majoring in Electrical Engineering, I will gain a strong fundamental foundation for understanding how electrical components operate that will enable me both to achieve my personal goals to be a lifelong learner and hacker, just as my Computer Science major has done for me.

+ What three adjectives would you use to describe yourself? Give examples of why and how you have demonstrated these through your actions.

Self-motivated, tenacious, and a dreamer. Up to today, every things I have built, every things I have destroyed, every things I have earned, every things I have lost, every triumps, every failures, I'm pround to be responsible for all those. Call me stubborn, disobedient but noone can force/motivate me to do anything, I motivate myself, I do what I love, and I love what I do. Henry Rollins is one of my life model. I mean I'm not nearly as awsome, but he and I share one common factor, "[We] don't have talent, [we] have tenacity". I can't think of any adjetive to effectively describe dreamer. I dream, a lot, everyday, I dream with my mind and do with my hands. Dreaming & Doing keep me from boredom, dreaming helps raising the bar for me. It just keeps me going.

+ What is one of your academic strengths and one of your academic weaknesses? Describe.

I tend to do well in math and science classes, where logic comes into play. And I tend to do not so well in languages, social classes.
I think it is so because of my personality. I'm a left-brainer, dou I enjoy art and music too. I find solving equations, applying theories interesting, while I find no point in history( I know history repeats itself, but it just doesnt click for me). And I put 200% effort in subjects that I love, and not so much in subjects that I don't. I guess I'm not considered well-rounded, but I believe in specialization.

+ What do you consider one of your greatest personal strengths?

Well my co-worker over the summer call me nutty, but I call it unafraid. People sometime describe me with the phrase "initiative" and "determination" or something along those lines. But all those root from me being "nutty", I'm not afraid to take on challeges, this is why I have great initiative, I'm not scared of difficulties, this is why I follow through with determination. Over the summer when I was assigned to make a facebook app, the CEO asked how long it was going to take?, I answered two weeks. And instantaneously my co-woker and my boss turned around and gave me a disbelief look. They were right I had no clue how to make a facebook app, I didn't even know where "2 weeks" came from. But hey I took the challege and I finished it all the way, granted somedays I stayed behind until 9. If I were a rational or at least sensible human being, I don't know if I could have done it.

+ Have there been any changes in your life or a particular situation that has occurred during your school years that you feel has affected you, your grades, or your participation in school? (Example: illness in family, moving, divorce, etc.)

I don't know what does it take to negatively affect me anymore. You know, how being exposed to diseases over time and immunity will naturally form. I went like check, check, check…for all those examples above. It doesn't matter how badly things get, I still know my worth, heck I was sold for $200 dollar at the age of 2 months, guess how much I'm worth now. Here is my life in a nutshell: born => parent divorced => sold by dad at 2 months (bought back by mom) => lived with no less than 20 different people =>moved back in with mom in 5th grades => moved constantly(no less than 2 digits locations) => moved to US => mom remarried => highschool(suck) => moved again => university => hit by depression and addiction => bounceed back =>  graduating => so here I'm standing.

+ Describe any volunteer experience and how it has impacted you or others

I have been tutoring disanvantaged elementary/middle school kids, for 2 hours every weekend, for almost 2 years now. These kids all face different challeges at a very young age, and some of the challeges I dont even know I can handdle. Remember when I was at my low point and struggled, people extended their hands for me, so I guesss I'm trying to do the same thing for these kids. Whether I teach them multiplication for 2 hours, or just purely entertain them for 2 hours, at the end I just hope they know that people care for them. The idea of people caring got me through some low points, and I hope it will do the same for these kids, wonderful kids.

+ Have you experienced living in another state or country?

Yes, in fact I was born and raised in another country for 14 years. It was a "great" time, but I'm ready for new advantures now.

+ What is the most important activity you have been involved with over the past four years? Why has it been important to you?

Programming is considered the activity that defines who I'm. I have always thought life sucks, which it does occationally, but programming teaches me that the power to make life sucks less is in my hand, on my finger tips, literally. Somehow I have become so much more active and optimistic, I can't stop myself seeking problems people face in every day life, and then solve them. And programming open many doors for me. I have met many amazing people, and fortunate enough to have a chance to work on amazing projects with those amazing people.

+ Are you the first in your family to attend college? Do you have any siblings in college, and if so, which college do they currently attend?

Yes, Im first in my immediate family to attend college. No, I don't have any siblings.

+ What is the role of conflict and diversity of ideas in shaping one's conclusions? How can one remain intellectually open to opposing ideas while still retaining one's own identity and/or beliefs?

To be a strong team player, one has to be able to listen to conflicting and diverse ideas in order to make the best decision. When viewing a certain issue, the varied ideas provide us with different perspectives. These different perspectives provide us with a well-rounded consideration, so that we can avoid bias in our conclusion to the problem at hand. In a team setting, it is even more imperative to take in different perspectives from all team members. To put it in a simple term, five brains are always better than one brain. Sometime it may seems difficult to come to a compromise with many different ideas. However, based con conflicts and different perspective, we can come up with the best suitable and fair conclusions. 
There is a misconception that one need to alter one’s identity and/or beliefs in oder to open to opposing ideas. This is simply not true. In fact, open to opposing ideas more than often helps to strengthen one’s own identity and/or beliefs. Being open to criticism and different opinions help us in our reasoning and thinking. More over, open to different arguments means we have an opportunity to consider the pros and cons of varied opinions, so we are not blinded by only one sided opinion. In a sense, we become wiser as we open to opposing ideas. This help us further more develop and strengthen our beliefs.

+ Imagine that you are editor of a magazine or journal in the fall of 2029. What would be the name of the magazine or journal? Draft the opening paragraphs of the lead article for that month. Discuss why you selected that topic.

A fourteen year olds just saved all of us...on a school project, and you heathens didn’t even know it.
 
The young hacker prodigy, Janna, describes it as a simple school project; however, the FBC(Federal Bureau of Cyber Security) views the attack in a more serious manner. Today, the FBC has officially acknowledged the sophisticated attack Janna pulled out last weekend. The speaker from FBC, Earl Stoner, calls “this is most serious and insidious security threat” that could have also been the most damaging if the attack was carried out by malicious black hats. During the attack, Janna successfully gained full access and control into several banking institutions(Bank of America, Capital One, Coca-Cola National Bank...). 

However, according to the FBC, the list of potential victims is much longer, ranging from every banking institutions to the financial system of Wall Street and even the Federal Reserve should feel vulnerable. The estimated damages if this loophole was discovered by malicious hackers could be measured up to the Trillions, yes with a capital T.
 
But hey, you don’t have anything to worry now. Janna was the first one to discover this security vulnerability, she immediately alerted the FBC way in advance. Janna is now working with the FBC along with banking and financial systems to patch this most damaging “school project.”
 
Janna says she plans to go further into the field of Computer Science and she will compete in the National Hacker Cup when she turns sixteen. Meanwhile, I hope she will get extra credits on this school project.
 
(In choosing this topic, I want to draw attention that not all hackers are as malicious as the connotation of the word. Also I hope Computer Science will be, as it should be, widely taught in high school, even as early as middle school. I also want to encourage more women to go into the field of Computer Science.)
